## Task 1: Compute Kinship using SNPRelate and GENESIS
a. Compute kinship using the SNPRelate and GENESIS package in R. You can use the
IBD family of functions, but note that you need to transform the plink format to GDS
format using the function snpgdsPED2GDS that takes the ped and map files.


##convert to the GDS format needed for our analysis:

      break
    }    
  }
}

# GDS (Genomic Data Structure)

**GDS** stands for **Genomic Data Structure**. It is a file format used to efficiently store and access large-scale genetic data, such as SNP genotype data.



| Method                                                                                                   | Best for                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| [snpgdsIBDKING](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/SNPRelate/versions/1.6.4/topics/snpgdsIBDKING)   | Quick, robust kinship estimates on large datasets |
| [snpgdsIBDMLE](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/SNPRelate/versions/1.6.4/topics/snpgdsIBDMLE)     | More accurate, maximum likelihood kinship         |

**Input:** You give it an IBD result object from `snpgdsIBDMLE`, which contains IBD/kinship estimates between individuals.

**Output:** It returns a data frame (`ibd_df`) listing pairs of individuals with their IBD estimates and related information.
b. Report the number of individuals who have a kinship > 0.1

### Annotation Process Explanation

This command performed the following operations:

1. **Input file**: `top_20_Qatari.vcf` - Our top 20 significant SNPs in VCF format

2. **Reference database**: `humandb/` - Directory containing ANNOVAR's reference databases

3. **Key parameters**:
   - `-buildver hg19` - Using human genome build 19 as the reference
   - `-out annotated_output` - Output file prefix name
   - `-remove` - Remove temporary files after completion
   - `-protocol refGene` - Using the RefSeq gene annotation database
   - `-operation g` - Perform gene-based annotation
   - `-nastring .` - Use "." to represent missing values
   - `-vcfinput` - Input is in VCF format
   - `-polish` - Generate a well-formatted output file
   - `-thread 8` - Use 8 CPU threads for parallel processing

4. **Annotation details**: The command searched for overlaps between our variants and:
   - Coding exons
   - UTRs (untranslated regions)
   - Introns
   - Intergenic regions
   - Splice sites
   
5. **Outputs generated**:
   - `annotated_output.hg19_multianno.txt` - Tab-delimited text file with annotations
   - `annotated_output.hg19_multianno.vcf` - VCF file with annotations in the INFO field

The annotation process successfully identified the genomic context of each variant, including:
- Gene location (if applicable)
- Functional effect (intronic, intergenic, UTR, etc.)
- Distance to nearest genes (for intergenic variants)
- Transcript information
- Potential effects on protein structure and function

This annotation step provides crucial biological context for our statistical associations, helping to interpret how these genetic variants might influence metabolite levels through their effects on gene function or regulation.

## Functional Distribution of Significant SNPs

The majority of our significant SNPs (65%) are located in intergenic regions, while 30% are found within gene introns. Only one variant (5%) is located in a 5' untranslated region (UTR5).

## Functional Analysis of Individual SNPs

### 1. rs11173032 (Chr 12)
This variant is located within an intron of the OS9 gene. OS9 encodes a protein involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins. Intronic variants can potentially affect gene expression through various mechanisms, including alternative splicing or by affecting regulatory elements within the intron.

### 2. rs41350745 (Chr 3)
This intergenic variant is positioned between the EGFEM1P pseudogene and the LINC02082 non-coding RNA gene. It is located 45,709 bp from EGFEM1P and 25,650 bp from LINC02082. While intergenic variants are often more challenging to functionally characterize, they may influence gene regulation through long-range enhancer or silencer activities.

### 3. rs17050199 (Chr 2)
Located in an intergenic region between LINC01793 and MIR4432HG, this variant is 79,926 bp from LINC01793 and nearly 1 Mb from MIR4432HG. Both of these genes produce non-coding RNAs, which play various roles in gene regulation.

### 4. rs2426466 (Chr 20)
This intergenic variant is positioned between LINC01524 (a long non-coding RNA) and TSHZ2 (a transcription factor). It is relatively close to LINC01524 (7,076 bp) but quite distant from TSHZ2 (314,856 bp). Its proximity to LINC01524 suggests a potential regulatory relationship.

### 5. rs7635068 (Chr 3)
Located in an intergenic region between TPRG1-AS1 (an antisense RNA) and TPRG1, this variant may affect the regulation of these genes. The relatively large distances from both genes (148,856 bp and 75,476 bp, respectively) suggest it may function as a distal regulatory element.

## Additional Notable Annotations

1. **rs2671637 (Chr 17)** - This is the only variant in our top set located in a 5' UTR, specifically in the WNT3 gene (NM_030753:c.-39C>T). Variants in 5' UTRs can affect mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and overall gene expression. WNT3 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays roles in development, cell differentiation, and metabolism.

2. **Gene-rich regions** - Several of our significant SNPs are located near multiple genes or regulatory elements, highlighting the complex genomic architecture of these regions.

## Minor Allele Frequencies

The minor allele frequencies (MAF) of our significant SNPs range from approximately 0.05 to 0.45, with an average MAF of approximately 0.18. This distribution suggests that both common and less common genetic variants contribute to metabolite variation in our population.

## Implications for Metabolite Association

The functional annotations provide important context for interpreting our metabolite associations:

1. **Non-coding predominance**: The predominance of variants in non-coding regions (intergenic and intronic) suggests that many metabolite-associated variants may act through regulatory mechanisms rather than by directly altering protein structure.

2. **Regulatory potential**: Several variants are positioned near non-coding RNAs or regulatory elements, suggesting they may influence metabolite levels by modulating gene expression.

3. **Novel biology**: The identification of variants near genes not previously associated with metabolism opens new avenues for investigating the genetic basis of metabolic traits.

## Conclusion

The functional annotation of our top SNPs reveals that most metabolite-associated variants in our study are located in non-coding regions of the genome. This suggests that regulatory mechanisms may play a prominent role in genetic influences on metabolite levels. The proximity of several variants to non-coding RNAs and regulatory genes further supports this hypothesis.

Further experimental validation would be required to confirm the functional impact of these variants on gene expression and metabolite levels. Integration with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data could provide additional insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved.

## Interpretation

### Individual SNP Findings

- **rs41350745 (Chr 3)**: The closest proxy SNP is rs55645172, located only 156 bp upstream, with perfect LD (r² = 1.0). This suggests that these variants are inherited together and likely represent the same association signal.

- **rs2426466 (Chr 20)**: The closest proxy is rs6022342, located 317 bp upstream, also with perfect LD (r² = 1.0). This close proximity and perfect correlation indicate they tag the same functional variant.

- **rs17050199 (Chr 2)**: Has rs7281035 as its closest proxy, located 2,518 bp downstream with very high LD (r² = 0.97). Despite the slightly greater distance, the strong correlation indicates they likely represent the same association signal.

- **rs11173032 (Chr 12)**: The proxy SNP rs7976856 is located 12,098 bp downstream with strong LD (r² = 0.93). This greater physical distance but maintained high correlation is common in regions with strong LD blocks.

- **rs7635068 (Chr 3)**: No proxy SNPs were identified in the SNIPA database. This could indicate that:
  * The SNP is in a region with low LD
  * The SNP is in a unique genomic region
  * There may be limited reference data for this region in the SNIPA database

### Regional Analysis

Regional plots were generated for each lead SNP using SNIPA's variant browser tool. These plots visualize the LD patterns and gene context around each association signal.

### Functional Context

The identification of proxy SNPs helps establish the credibility of our GWAS findings and defines the genomic regions most likely to contain the causal variants. Further functional annotation of these regions is recommended to identify potential biological mechanisms underlying the observed metabolite associations.

### Conclusion

This analysis has successfully identified proxy SNPs for four of our five lead SNPs. These proxies help define the genomic regions of interest for follow-up functional studies. For rs7635068, the lack of proxy SNPs suggests it may represent a unique signal requiring targeted follow-up.
